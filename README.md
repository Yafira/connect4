Exactly like the actual game except in form of a Graphic User Interface. This is a turn based game with a GUI, where players take turns dropping their marker into a column until either someone wins, or the board is full. It displays the current player on each turn. At the end of the game , the winner is displayed and asked if they want to play again.
